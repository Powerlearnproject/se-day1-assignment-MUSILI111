#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is systematic application of enginering principles methods and tools to the development and maintanance of high quality software systems.
the importance of software engineering is that it helps to create systems that helps to power various aspects of life .


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastery complexcity
mastering machine
masering process

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1:requirements=this gathering and documenting user needs and system requrements
2:design=creating high level detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
3:implementations=writing a code and building software according to design specification
4:testing=conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality stardards and functionality
5:deployment=releasing software to users
6:maintainance=enhancing software by updating,and repair after deployed to the users

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards,eg requrements design and implementaion
while agile is the iterative and increaments with mulitiple cycle.eg,testing si done contiously after a while.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software engineeer=writes the codes and implements software solutions
quality assuarance=ensures high quality of software by designing and executing tests to the software
project manager=oversees planning,implementaion amd delivery of the software system.
system architect=designs overall structure of software system
ux designer=creates userinterface and designs use experience for software appiliaction

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides comprensive tools for writing ,debugging and testing codes eg visual studios.
VCS=software tool for tracking changes to source codes and coordinating work among team members eg git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements=ensureing that the engineer have all requiements and are documented to ensure that changes do not happen during work
tight deadline the engineer should focus fully on project to ensure that the job meets the deadline

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing=testing individual components of the system.
intergration testing =testing interactions between different components or subsystems
acceptance testing=testing the software against user based requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models
crafting questions or statements to get best possible for the ai

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
describe an african     improved version=describe an african woman from kenya
this ensures the ai gives you the best possible answear
